# FAQ

## Is TopoAccess a coding agent?

No. TopoAccess is a repo-intelligence sidecar for coding agents.

## Does TopoAccess require a model?

No. TopoAccess is model-agnostic by default. Exact lookup, command lookup, artifact lookup, and post-edit validation can run without a model.

## When can a model be used?

Optional model-backed synthesis is category-gated for change planning, model-required narrative, report synthesis, and troubleshooting. Local adapters are configured through workspace profiles.

## Does public CI require GPU, LM Studio, Ollama, or Qwen?

No. Public CI is model-free.

## Why does TopoAccess save tokens?

It avoids broad repository dumps for deterministic questions and gives harnesses compact, provenance-backed context packs.
